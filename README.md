homebrew-grc
============

Fork of official grc formular


Background
----------

`brew install grc` fails because the Generic Colouriser`s site is down. This formula uses a mirror provided by pengwynn.


Usage
-----

The original formula mxcl/master/grc cannot be overwritten, so to install a this version you can use an extended syntax:

    brew install mifix/grc/grc


To untap, use `brew untap`
